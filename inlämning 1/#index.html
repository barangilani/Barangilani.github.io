                            Urmiye have very nice nature with hight mountains and largest saltwater.Urmiye is on the border north of Turkey and in the south in Irak.
                            Urmiye is the 10th most population city in Iran.
                            The city's inhabitants are predominantly Azerbaijanis who speak the Azerbaijani language.There are also minorities of Kurds, Assyrians, and Armenians.The city is the trading center for a fertile agricultural region where fruits (especially apples and grapes) and tobacco are grown.The Christian history of Urmia is well preserved, and is especially evident in the city's many churches and cathedrals.

                            An important town by the 9th century, the city has had a diverse population which has at times included Muslims (Shias and Sunnis), Christians (Catholics, Protestants, Nestorians, and Orthodox), Jews, Bahá'ís and Sufis. Around 1900, Christians made up more than 40% of the city's population; however, most of the Christians fled in 1918 as a result of the Persian Campaign during World War I and the Armenian and Assyrian Genocides by Ottoman Empire.

                            Urmia has many parks and touristic coastal villages in the Shore of Urmia Lake. The oldest park in Urmia, called Park-e Saat, was established in the first Pahlavi's era. Urmia's largest park is Ellar Bagi Park (Azerbaijani "People`s Garden") along the Shahar Chayi, or the "City River".

                            Lake Urmia was second only to the Caspian Sea as the largest saltwater lake in the Middle East, a haven for birds and bathers. Since the early 1970s nature and humanity have chipped away at this gem tucked in northwestern Iran, reducing its size by about 80 percent over the past 30 years. The flamingos that feasted on brine shrimp in this UNESCO biosphere reserve are mostly gone. So are the pelicans, the egrets, and the ducks. Even the tourists who flocked to Lake Urmia for therapeutic baths in its warm, hypersaline waters are staying away.
